In a time of concerns about slowing the transmission of COVID-19, increased surveillance combined with AI solutions can improve monitoring and reduce the human effort needed to limit the spread of this disease.

Since the anouncement of a lockdown, generalized in many counntries over the world due to the spread of COVID-19, Zindi community has started a new type of challenges called <span style='color:red'>#ZINDIWEEKENDZ </span>. It is a set of competitions based on data science in order to permit to all the #zindians the development of AI based solutions in order to use their skills for giving their community some technical means and  viable solutions to their community in this biological war.
A challenge is taking place every weekend from April to May 2020.

This hackathon was about predicting whether a person in an image is wearing a face mask or not. It was hosted by [Zindi](https://zindi.africa/hackathons/spot-the-mask-challenge/) and lasted for 3 days (from Thursday 17 April to Sunday 19).  

##  ðŸ˜·<span style='color:green'> The solution </span> ðŸ§ 
Our solution is based on the architechture of the well known model <a href="https://pytorch.org/hub/pytorch_vision_densenet/">Densnet</a> and uses the technique of transfer learning to get some learned features form others tasks and use them in this contest to help our custom model to make accurate predictions.

The main framework used to implement the model is <a href="https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/">Pytorch</a>. Some of us also used [Tensorflow 2.0](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [keras](https://keras.io/) and [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) when experimenting.

With this model and with all the others techniques applied, we have been able to get the following results:
