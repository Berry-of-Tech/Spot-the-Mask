## <span style='color:green'> Description </span>


In the midst of concerns over COVID-19 transmission, combining AI solutions with increased surveillance can improve monitoring and reduce the human effort needed to limit the disease's spread.
 

##  <span style='color:green'> The solution </span> 
Our solution is based on the architecture of the well-known model <a href="https://pytorch.org/hub/pytorch_vision_densenet/">Densnet</a> and uses the technique of transfer learning to get some learned features from other tasks and use them in this contest to help our custom model to make accurate predictions.

The main framework used to implement the model is <a href="https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/">Pytorch</a>.

With this model and with all the other techniques applied, the LogLoss score is **0.023863371267641684**
